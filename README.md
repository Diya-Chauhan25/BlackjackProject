# BlackjackProject
Blackjack card game project


Overview:
The goal of this project is to extend the base card game code provided into a fully functional Blackjack game. Blackjack is a popular casino game where players compete against the dealer to achieve a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Each player begins with two cards and may choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (end their turn). The dealer follows fixed rule; drawing cards until reaching at least 17. The winner is determined by comparing hand totals between the player and the dealer at the end of each round.
The base code is written in Java and includes foundational classes such as Card, Player, Game, and GroupOfCards. These classes are designed using object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and modularity. Our extension builds on this foundation by adding Blackjack-specific logic, including card value calculations (with special handling for Aces), turn management for both player and dealer, and determining round outcomes. The final game will be playable in a console environment.
